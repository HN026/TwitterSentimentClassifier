# Evaluating your system

For evaluating your system, you simply need an individual predictions file for each of the tasks. The format of the predictions file should be the same as the output examples in the predictions folder (one output label per line as per the original test file). The predictions included as an example in this repo correspond to the best model evaluated in the paper, i.e., RoBERTa re-trained on Twitter (RoB-Rt in the paper).  

### Example usage

```bash
python evaluation_script.py
```
The script takes the TweetEval gold test labels and the predictions from the "predictions" folder by default, but you can set this to suit your needs as optional arguments.

### Optional arguments

Three optional arguments can be modified: 

*--tweeteval_path*: Path to TweetEval datasets. Default: *"./datasets/"*

*--predictions_path*: Path to predictions directory. Default: *"./predictions/"*

*--task*: Use this to get single task detailed results *(emoji|emotion|hate|irony|offensive|sentiment|stance)*. Default: ""

Evaluation script sample usage from the terminal with parameters:

```bash
python evaluation_script.py --tweeteval_path ./datasets/ --predictions_path ./predictions/ --task emoji
```
(this script would output the breakdown of the results for the emoji prediction task only)
